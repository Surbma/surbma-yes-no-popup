Shows a popup with age verification options. One of the best plugin for +18 adult sites or any sites, that requires any confirmation from a visitor.

== Description ==

This plugin is showing a Popup for visitors to verify their ages on your page. YES button will close the Popup and visitors can continue reading your content. NO button will redirect visitors to another URL, set by you to inform them about your policy.

This plugin can be used on 18+ adult sites, restricted content websites or any websites, where a visitor confirmation about age, knowledge, warning is necessary to continue reading the website. Even can be used for online marketing tricks.

This plugin can be an alternative for other Cookie Notice plugins to inform users that your site uses cookies and to comply with the EU cookie law regulations.

**IMPORTANT:** the popup is intentionally obtrusive and can not be closed, except clicking on the yes or no buttons.

**POPUP POSITIONS:** You can set where to show the popup, for example: only on frontpage, only on category pages, only on special pages or posts, even for Custom Post Types and more...

**FULL CUSTOMIZATIONS:** Every text is customizable, even the button's texts! You can also set the design of the buttons and you have the option to make the first or the second button to be the confirmation button.

**THEMES:** There are popup themes to choose the design, you like. The Full Page Themes are hiding the entire content behind the popup.

**FULL CONTROL:** Set cookie expiration for visitors, so the popup won't show again in X days, you set.

**MEMBERSHIP MODE:** You can disable popup for logged in users, so your members will not see any popups at all. You can always show the popup to all visitors, who are not logged in, even if they clicked on the Yes button. There is a "One button mode" also, that will hide the second button, so you can show only one option to your visitors. This option is best paired with the "always show to all visitors, who are not logged in" option, so you can keep your content safe.

**DEVELOPER FRIENDLY:** If you enable debug mode, popup will show always, on every refresh, so you can test how it works.
